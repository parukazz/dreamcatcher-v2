# Dreamcatcher Website

This is my first official project, and I've poured my heart and soul into it. I'm incredibly passionate about this project, building it from scratch, searching for inspiration, concepts, and everything in between.

Here's the tech stack I used:
- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Google Fonts

I hope you'll enjoy this website when it's launched! It's not published yet, so stay tuned! ✌️✌️
